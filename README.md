Website downtime can be truly frustrating for both your business and customers. It can break a line of communication, leave both parties in the dark and has the potential to impact your brand and your business in a variety of ways.

Adding a reverse proxy server or load balancer adds flexibility to your web server setup. For instance, if a server of a given type is overloaded, another server of the same type can easily be added; if a server is down, it can easily be replaced. you use a load balancer to distribute traffic across a number of servers. Even if an application is poorly written, or has problems with scaling, a load balancer can improve the user experience without any other changes. Load balancers can lead to strong improvements in performance because they prevent one server from being overloaded while other servers wait for traffic. They also make it easy to expand your web server capacity, as you can add relatively low‑cost servers and be sure they’ll be put to full use.

Replication can improve both durability and availability by storing separate copies of your data in multiple zones or regions and automatically failing over between clusters if needed. you can still use replication by handling requests with one cluster and keeping another cluster as a near-real-time backup. If the serving cluster becomes unavailable, you can minimize downtime by manually failing over to the backup cluster.

Continuous data protection also called continuous backup or real-time backup refers to backup of computer data by automatically saving a copy of every change made to that data, essentially capturing every version of the data that the user saves. It allows the user or administrator to restore data to any point in time. Backup continuously your daily work.

This plugin uses MySQL replication that can configure the database in such a way that single master database can replicate the data to multiple slaves, those will work as multiple read only databases. In Master Slave architecture we configure one database as a master and another database as a slave so that master database replicate its data to the slave which become the master when the primary master goes down and protect your application from hitting the dead end.

3. Ensure zero downtime of your Wordpress website, store.
4. stores your data across multiple geographically distant Availability Zones.
5. disaster recovery database backup.
6. master-slave where the master handles the write transactions and the slave server only reads the data into a mirrored database.
7. load balancer sends requests to the server that can handle each transaction with the best performance.
8. If your customers are in two geographic locations, you can minimize latency in accessing objects
9. Provides for quick recovery if one database server experiences a failure
10. Allows for load balancing across the multiple database servers
11. By spreading data across multiple machines, users can ensure that their application data continues to be available even in the event of a hardware failure.
